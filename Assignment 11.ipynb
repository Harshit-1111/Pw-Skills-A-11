    "'''Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously.\n",
    "                 Each process runs independently and has its own memory space.\n",
    "                 Processes do not share memory by default but can communicate using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes or queues.\n",
    "Multithreading: Multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process.\n",
    "                Threads share the same memory space and can access the same data and variables. \n",
    "                They can communicate and synchronize easily, but they can also introduce synchronization challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Provides true parallelism by utilizing multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "                 Each process runs on a separate core and can perform tasks concurrently. Well-suited for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Multithreading: In Python, multithreading is subject to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which limits true parallelism. \n",
    "                Multiple threads may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "                However, it's suitable for I/O-bound tasks and concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Processes are isolated from each other and run independently.\n",
    "                 Errors or crashes in one process do not affect others.\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads within the same process share the same memory space. \n",
    "                An error or crash in one thread can potentially affect the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: May involve more complex communication mechanisms like queues or shared memory for inter-process communication.\n",
    "Multithreading: Typically involves simpler synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or conditions for coordinating threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Ideal for CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized, such as numerical calculations, data processing, and rendering.\n",
    "                 Also suitable for running multiple independent tasks in parallel.\n",
    "Multithreading: Well-suited for I/O-bound tasks like network communication, file I/O, and GUI applications,\n",
    "                where threads can wait for I/O operations without blocking the entire process."
